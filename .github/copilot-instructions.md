- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	Modern Java Spring JMS showcase with multi-datacenter support for IBM MQ and ActiveMQ Artemis, configurable via YAML, using Jakarta JMS

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	Project structure created manually with:
	- Gradle build configuration with Spring Boot 3.2.0
	- Jakarta JMS dependencies for IBM MQ and ActiveMQ Artemis
	- Multi-datacenter configuration support
	- Connection pooling and transaction management
	- REST API for testing
	- JMS listeners with commit/rollback support

- [x] Customize the Project
	Developed a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.
	Applied modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.
	Skip this step for "Hello World" projects.

- [x] Install Required Extensions
	No extensions needed - marked as completed.

- [x] Compile the Project
	All previous steps completed.
	Dependencies resolved.
	Project compiles successfully with BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
	Production readiness improvements:
	- Phase 1 COMPLETED: Fixed configuration property mismatches
	  - Added missing properties to FailoverConfig (crossRegionEnabled, excludeUnhealthyDatacenters)
	  - Added missing properties to LoadBalancingConfig (enabled, weights, healthCheckWeightAdjustment)
	  - Added missing Retry configuration class with comprehensive retry logic
	  - All configuration properties now properly mapped with getters/setters
	- Tests passing with clean build

- [x] Create and Run Task
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
	Skip this step otherwise.

- [x] Launch the Project
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Verify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists and contains current project information.
	Clean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.
	COMPLETED: Created comprehensive USER_GUIDE.md (1200+ lines) and QUICK_REFERENCE.md for complete documentation suite. Updated README.md to reference new documentation. Cleaned up all HTML comments from copilot-instructions.md.
